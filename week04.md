# Tips 22-28

## #Day22 Callable Class

In flutter we can call instance of a class like we call method.

What you have to do is defile a `call()` method of any return type or arguments. that `call()` method will be called when you call the instance.

    void main() {
        var member = CallableClass();
        member("Flutter");
    }

    class CallableClass{
        call(String name){
            print("Name is $name");
        }
    }

## #Day23 ListWheelScrollView

We can implement following Wheel List using `ListWheelScrollView` in flutter.

Just give it the children and it will start working for you.

You can customize the wheel with Constructor arguments of `ListWheelScrollView` play with them.

    ListWheelScrollView(
        children: <Widget>[
            ..Children Widgets

## #Day25 Google Fonts in flutter

With the pub.dev package `google_fonts` you can use any google fonts without downloading them.

Just give the textStyle as any google fonts.

Want to set other textStyles properties? Just provide `textStyle` to the font (Which is a textStyle itself)

    Text(
        'Notched Rectangular Fab',
        style: GoogleFonts.pacifico(
            textStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.red),
        ),)

## #Day26 Hero Animation (Shared Element Transition)

### **Do you want your Widget/Image to fly from one screen to another?**

Flutter makes it super easy to do **Shared Element / Hero animation** with Widget called `Hero`.
Just give **same `tag`** for the `Hero` widget in both screen and your Widget will start flying from one screen to another.

Caution : Do not give a static string as tag if your UI has dynamic data like List, use a value of object like title,id etc as tag

    //First Screen

    FirstPageWidget extends StatelessWidget{
    return Scaffold(
        ...
        Hero(
            tag: player.name
            child: Image.network(url)
        )
        //Other player List
        ...
        );
    }

    //Second Page

    SecondPageWidget extends StatelessWidget{
    return Scaffold(
        ...
        Hero(
            tag: player.name
            child: Image.network(url)
            )
        //Player details
        ...
        );
    }

## #Day27 Dart function/constructor Arguments

There are three types of arguments (Function arguments and constructor arguments work the same way).

1. Normal Parameters (✅✅Short & ❌Flexible) => required, requires all arguments to be called in order, most concise (doesn't need argument names),least flexible.

2. Named Parameters (✅Short & ✅✅Flexible) => Optional, can be called in any order BUT must provide the argument name.

3. Positional Parameters (✅✅Short & ✅Flexible) => optional but we cannot skip any argument on left to provide argument right to it. Does not require argument name.

        void main() {
            normalFunction("Laxman", "Bhattarai", 26, 65);

            optionalFunction("Laxman", "Bhattarai");
            optionalFunction("Laxman", "Bhattarai", age: 26);
            optionalFunction("Laxman", "Bhattarai", weight: 65);
            optionalFunction("Laxman", "Bhattarai", weight: 65, age: 26);

            positionalFunction("Laxman", "Bhattarai");
            positionalFunction("Laxman", "Bhattarai", 26);
            positionalFunction("Laxman", "Bhattarai", 26, 65);
        }


        //Requires all arguments passed in order, i.e. no meaning of default parameters
        normalFunction(String firstName, String lastName, int age, int weight) {
            print("$firstName $lastName age: $age weight: $weight");
        }


        //Optional, can be called in any order BUT must provide the argument name.
        optionalFunction(String firstName, String lastName,
            {int age = 18, int weight = 60}) {
            print("$firstName $lastName age: $age weight: $weight");
        }

        //Optional, doesn't need argument name  but cannot be skipped an argument on left to provide argument on right of it.
        positionalFunction(String first, String last,[int age = 18, int weight = 60]) {
            print("$first $last age: $age weight: $weight");
        }

## #Day28 AnimatedContainer

`ImplicitlyAnimatedWidget`s like `AnimatedAlign,AnimatedContainer, AnimatedPadding, AnimatedTheme` are easy way to do animation.

`AnimatedContainer()` is one of the most common.

You can animate any properties of `container` with `AnimatedContainer`. Mastery of this widget alone can get you far ahead in you animation game.

Just provide the changed value like

    height, width,padding,transform,decoration(backgroundcolor, border radius & alignment etc.

along with curve then AnimatedContainer will automatically do the animation for you.

The following animation is done with just `AnimatedContainer()`
